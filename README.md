## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.dev/) - Angular Framework
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com//) - For styles

### What I learned

For this project my main goal was timing my coding time so I could have an idea how long
would it take me to complete the component. I didn't do any special besides applying my
previous knowledge from my last project.

### Continued development

For future development I will apply the AGILE system to keep track of my project.

### Useful resources

- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com//) - For style guides.

## Acknowledgments

The code may not be perfect compared to my sensei @jonasschmedtman but I need to thank him because he has shown me the ropes and now I am a confident web
designer. Another important instructor is @MaximilianSchwarzm√ºller in Udemy.
